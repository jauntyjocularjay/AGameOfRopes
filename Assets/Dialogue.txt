In-Battle Grievances

1. Dirk uses words, Iris uses force
“I’m surprised you haven’t tried to talk your way out of this. It seems to be the only thing you’re good at.”

	Berate:
	Respond: “I am quite good at it, and its gotten us out of a pickle on more 	than one occasion.”
	Concede:

2. Iris and Dirk use similar weaponry and always squabble over gear
“I never get any of the good loot. Who ever heard of a bard using warrior gear? And what is that weapon anyway? An axe? An instrument? It’s ridiculous!”

	Berate: “Mordred is a more reliable companion than you will ever be!”
	“(snicker) You *named* it? That’s pathetic.”
	Respond: “I assumed you wouldn’t want this small-time loot. Didn’t your 	parents buy you the best armor money could buy?”
	Concede:

3. Dirk gets in trouble with the Guard, Iris springs traps


4. Dirk wants safety, Iris wants respect
“You’re overly cautious. How are we ever going to get the respect of the townspeople if we’re always taking small jobs, or worse, giving up on big ones!”

	Berate: “No one will respect us if we’re dead!”
	Respond:
	Concede:

5. Iris believes Dirk only quests with her because a lich’s curse charmed him
