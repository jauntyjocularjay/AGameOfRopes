Establishing Scene

Iris: "You always do this!"

Dirk: "Do not!"

Iris: "You do! (in a mocking tone) 'I posted the quest, I get the super cool gear'. I’M the one who slew the damn dragon. I should get first dibs."

Dirk: "Yes, you killed the dragon. Which, I’ll remind you, *wasn’t* part of the plan."

Iris: "You and your plans. Why do they always seem to involve seducing something?"

Dirk: "Diplomacy is a very effective to-"

Iris: "Grrrrrr. THAT’S IT! We’re settling this once and for all."

Dirk: "Iris, ple-"

Iris: "I challenge you to a duel. First to submit has to listen

Dirk: "It’s on!"

	Concede:

2. Iris and Dirk use similar weaponry and always squabble over gear

	“(snicker) You *named* it? That’s pathetic.”

	Concede:

3. Dirk gets in trouble with the Guard, Iris springs traps


4. Dirk wants safety, Iris wants respect
“You’re overly cautious. How are we ever going to get the respect of the townspeople if we’re always taking small jobs, or worse, giving up on big ones!”
